### A - ∴ (Therefore)
The cat Snuke wants to play a popular Japanese game called ÅtCoder,
so Iroha has decided to teach him Japanese. When counting pencils in Japanese,
the counter word "本" follows the number. The pronunciation of this word varies 
depending on the number. Specifically, the pronunciation of "本" in the phrase 
" N 本" for a positive integer N not exceeding 999 is as follows: hon when the digit
in the one's place of N is 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , or 9 ; pon when the digit in the one's 
place of N is 0 , 1 , 6 or 8 ; bon when the digit in the one's place of N is 3.
Given N , print the pronunciation of "本" in the phrase " N 本".

### B - ... (Triple Dots)
We have a string S consisting of lowercase English letters.
If the length of S is at most K , print S without change. If the length of S exceeds K 
, extract the first K characters in S , append ... to the end of them, and print the result.

### C - : (Colon)
Consider an analog clock whose hour and minute hands are A and B centimeters long, respectively.
An endpoint of the hour hand and an endpoint of the minute hand are fixed at the same 
point, around which each hand rotates clockwise at constant angular velocity. 
It takes the hour and minute hands 12 hours and 1 hour to make one full rotation, respectively.
At 0 o'clock, the two hands overlap each other. H hours and M minutes later, what is the distance
in centimeters between the unfixed endpoints of the hands?

### D - .. (Double Dots)
There is a cave. The cave has N rooms and M passages. The rooms are numbered 1 to N , and
the passages are numbered 1 to M . Passage i connects Room A i and Room B i bidirectionally.
One can travel between any two rooms by traversing passages. Room 1 is a special room with an
entrance from the outside. It is dark in the cave, so we have decided to place a signpost in each room except Room 1. 
The signpost in each room will point to one of the rooms directly connected to that room with a passage. 
Since it is dangerous in the cave, our objective is to satisfy the condition below for each room except Room 1.
If you start in that room and repeatedly move to the room indicated by the signpost in the room you are in, you
will reach Room 1 after traversing the minimum number of passages possible. Determine whether there is a way to
place signposts satisfying our objective, and print one such way if it exists.
