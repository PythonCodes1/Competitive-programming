Problem Statement
AtCoder Inc. holds a contest every Saturday.

There are two types of contests called ABC and ARC, and just one of them is held at a time.

The company holds these two types of contests alternately: an ARC follows an ABC and vice versa.

Given a string 
S
 representing the type of the contest held last week, print the string representing the type of the contest held this week.
